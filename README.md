Creating publication quality tables with double headers that export to Word or pdf

This repository contains materials from an R Cafe session where we walked through how to generate APA style summary tables from R with word and pdf output when the desired table format includes double-headers with variable column spans.

The materials in the repo include:

- the survey data (example_GTA_data.csv)
- the desired output table hand-formatted in Excel (example_APA analysis.xlsx), and a script that generates the dataframe to be formatted in Excel (example_GTA study analyses.R)
- a demo using tidyverse and flextable for word output (APA-table-demo.Rmd & rendered .html)
- a demo using tidyverse and papaja for pdf output (embedded in an APA manuscript template: Table_papaja.Rmd and .pdf)
